## Development
### SCSS
Since all css compiled to `css-compile/` is included in `.gitignore` to avoid merge conflicts, it needs to be compiled from `scss/` after pulling files from this repository. Run `scss scss:css-compiled --style compressed` from the base directory or use the provided `scss.sh` script to start a watcher.
